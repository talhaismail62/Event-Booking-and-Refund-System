# Event Booking & Refund System

## Project Overview

This **Event Booking & Refund System** is a web application designed to help **banquet halls** manage event bookings, payments, availability, and refunds. The system ensures that no event is double-booked and handles bookings and refunds atomically to maintain data integrity.

### Key Features

- **Booking management**: Allows customers to book events and manage reservations.
- **Refund system**: Handles cancellations and refunds automatically.
- **Concurrency control**: Ensures that multiple users cannot book the same hall at the same time.
- **Role-based access control**: Different user roles (admin, event organizer, customer) with appropriate permissions.

The application leverages **PostgreSQL** for the database, **Node.js** for the backend API, and **React** for the frontend.
